# SimpleBpyCameraScript
a simple script for generating RGB, normal and depth images from Blender.

Blender contains a default python IDE, but it is stll difficult to debug in it. The python APIs are actually command interaction, and only if you are familiar with the GUI of Blender, you know why some functions are active or not. So make sure the buttoms are checked when functions are not work.

A simple workflow is described in the PDF file in Chinese.
